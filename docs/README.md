  Hi, I'm a programming enthusiast and a Computer Science student. I'm passionate about discovering the inside     scoop on technology, solving problems with code, and constantly learning new tools. I'm also a fan of anime, a   source of inspiration that fuels my creativity and my perspective on the digital world. I love combining my      interests to create unique projects and learn from every experience.
